It draws primarily on musical and cultural sources from the 1980s and early 1990s while also being associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and technoculture. Early incarnations of vaporwave relied on the sampling of sources such as Japanese city pop, smooth jazz, retro elevator music, R&B, lounge music, and dance music from the 1980s and 1990s.
